      Electronic Gadgets a website that uses webscraping code written in Python
      to compare the prices of electronic products across the India's leading online scrapping.

      To use the webscraper the SuperUser creates the product and gives it a
      Category and Name. In this same section the URL for each electronic product
      is then entered and stored into the database. Once the load-prices.py file
      is ran it will go through each URL in the database and scrape the prices
      from each webpage. Erroneous URLs/prices will be flagged in the terminal
      to the user.

      As of january 2024 this webscraper currently works for Flipkart, Amazon
      and Snapdeal.
